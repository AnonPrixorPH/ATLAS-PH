# ATLAS-PH
```
Because I can't put everything in the same zip, github doesn't accept the file, it only needs to be up to 25mb, sorry.

Direction:

Unpack the Methods.zip and Put it on AtlasAPI_Methods directory, and execute the atlas.py
```

#INSTALL
```
git clone https://github.com/AnonPrixorPH/ATLAS-PH.git; cd ATLAS-PH

sh install.sh
```
